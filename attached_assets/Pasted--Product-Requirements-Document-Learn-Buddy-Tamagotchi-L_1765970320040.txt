## Open Questions

1. Should managers have "admin creatures" that reflect team performance?
2. Do we allow users to name their creature?
3. Should there be a "creature sanctuary" to view retired/previous evolution stages?
4. How do we handle users who switch stores or get promoted?
5. Should we incorporate AR features for mobile (creature in real world)?
6. What's our monetization strategy? (B2B licensing? Freemium model?)
